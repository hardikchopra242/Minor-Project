## Nervousness Tracking and Confidence Enhancement Guidance System Based on IoT
Nervousness, anxiety, and exaggeration during some critical stages of life can't be fruitful
sometimes. Often ahead of the camera or while facing the audience, we discover ourselves
during a situation or in a position where we aren't ready to have direct control over our
body language, which may cause a negative impact of our personality over people's minds
who are involved in communication with us. With this in mind, our research or project will
be intended towards a solution to the present problem that may help whole humanity and
that they are going to be ready to deliver what's best in them with remarkable aplomb. Our
project will include an **IoT-based wearable device** connected to an **App-Based interface
via the cloud**. This research or project is administered with the intention that whenever an
individual attends or is involved in any critical engagement, such as a meeting or an
interview, this device will generate a report supporting how that person reacts towards
things based upon various body parameters. This report can be analysed on a web or
android app-based dashboard. The information alongside his assessment of varied body
parameters also includes a suggestion chart that means the person is on the way to cater
to that situation swiftly and boosts their self-worth to a higher level. During a survey
conducted by **IJARSE**, it has been observed that many individuals lack self-worth while
presenting their ideas or something else ahead of the audience or within a gaggle. So, our
project will cater to that problem by presenting different ideas to an individual to boost
their confidence level.
